# About Mypics
Mypics is a simple React JS application using an Unsplash API to pull images based on the user's search term.

My objective is to use the app to build a simple docker image and run it with minikube on a local environment and on AWS with Kubernetes (KOPS and EKS) in the context of tutorial setup.

## Sources
- Folder src contains the JS files
- Build the image using the Dockerfile 
- File webapp.yaml for building a local minikube cluster
